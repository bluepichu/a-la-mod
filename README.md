#### Your Chat, Your Way

**À la Mod** is a chat client designed to be as modular as possible.  This means that the user - and not the app designer - is given full control over how content is sent and viewed.

The current version of À la Mod can be used [here](http://a-la-mod.herokuapp.com/).

## Releases

* **French Vanilla (0.1)** - The current latest version.  Supports all basic chat features.
* **Waffle Cone (0.0)** - An extremely unstable version used for initial testing.  There is no specific "release point" as this encompasses everything from the beginning to French Vanilla.
